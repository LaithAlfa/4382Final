                    <h2>Why Choose Socks N' Stocks?</h2>
                    <p>Have you ever had cold feet? Laith sure has (it's a genetic condition and he doesn't like to talk about it). We work hard together to provide the very best socks and stocks that the world has to offer. We love our feet and Laith loves your feet. He wants nothing more than for you to love your feet as well. <br> <br>
                        From a group of friends who paired up together in a class, we hope to bring some class to your toes. Please buy our stuff. </p>
