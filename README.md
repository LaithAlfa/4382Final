## Project Notes

We want to provide a website that will give visitors the option to purchase premium and potentially personalized socks and stockings for them or their loved ones. 

When searching for “socks” in Google, the first link that isn’t an ad is for happysocks.com. Upon visiting their website, you are immediately hit with vivid and colorful pictures and very few words. To me, this states that their target market is the fairly new “Hipster” market (those who want to be trendy, but ahead of the trend curve). We feel that this may be a good representation of the sock and stocking market and a target that we would like to aim for as well.

Ideally, we would have a place to purchase socks that are unique to our store. With an engaging front-end design, we can have the visitors to our website become sold on the idea of purchasing new and fun socks and stockings from us and solely us.
